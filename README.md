# Fuel-Consumption-Prediction-using-RBF-Networks-A-Case-Study-on-Miles-per-Gallon-MPG-Prediction
This project presents a case study on the use of Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks for predicting fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG). The goal of this project is to design and develop an RBF network that can predict the fuel consumption of a vehicle given a set of input variables.

The first step in the project is to develop a dataset for training and testing the RBF network. The dataset includes a range of variables such as vehicle weight, horsepower, displacement, and acceleration, as well as the target variable - the fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG). The dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing values or outliers and normalized to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.

The next step is to design the RBF network. The RBF network is a type of artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer receives the input variables, the hidden layer processes the input variables using radial basis functions, and the output layer produces the predicted MPG value.

The RBF network is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, such as the backpropagation algorithm. The algorithm adjusts the weights and biases of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual MPG values in the training dataset.

The performance of the RBF network is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient. The model is also tested on a separate validation dataset to evaluate its generalization performance.

The case study provides insights into the use of RBF networks for fuel consumption prediction and its potential for enhancing fuel efficiency. It also discusses the limitations and challenges of the RBF network approach and suggests possible areas for future research.

Overall, this case study provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the automotive industry who are interested in using machine learning techniques, such as RBF networks, for predicting fuel consumption and enhancing fuel efficiency.
